Hi, my name is Nico "Noggi" Schrodt. I´m currently 21 years old and i´m an apprentice in software development in Germany. I mainly develop in Java but i also have some 
knowledge in C# (yes, i like object oriented programming :D). 

This account is my public repository where i put some basic libraries and programs for others to use and expand.
